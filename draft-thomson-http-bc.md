# Shared Caching for HTTPS

Shared caches allow an HTTP server to offload the responsibility for delivering
certain content.  Content in the shared cache can be accessed efficiently by
multiple clients, saving the origin server from having to serve those requests
and ensuring that clients receive responses to cached requests more quickly.

Proxy caching is the most common configuration for shared caching.  A proxy
cache is either explicitly configured by a client, discovered as a result of
being automatically configured.

HTTPS [RFC2818] prevents the use of proxies by creating an authenticated
end-to-end connection to the origin server or its gateway that is authenticated.
This provides a critical protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, but it
also prevents the proxy from acting as a shared cache.

Clients do not direct queries for `https` URIs to proxies.  Clients configured
with a proxy use the CONNECT pseudo-method (Section 4.3.6 of [RFC7231]) with any
explicitly configured or discovered proxies to create an end-to-end tunnel.
Transparent proxies are unable to intercept connections that are protected with
TLS.

This document describes a method that enables shared caching for a limited set
of `https` resources, as selected by the server.  The server conditionally
delegates the hosting of secure content to itself.  This delegation includes a
marker that signals permission for a client to send a request for an `https`
resource via a proxy rather than insisting on an end-to-end TLS connection.


## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have the special meaning
defined in [RFC2119].

This document uses the term "proxy cache" to refer to a proxy [RFC7230] that
operates an HTTP cache [RFC7234].


# Same-Host Secure Content Delegation

The secure content delegation mechanism defined in [SCD] is used to create a
separate resource that contains encrypted and integrity protected content.
To enable caching, the primary and secondary servers can be the same server.

A client that signals a willingness to support delegation is provided with a
response that uses a proxy-enabled out-of-band encoding that behaves identically
to the out-of-band encoding defined in [I-D.reschke-http-oob-encoding].  The
out-of-band encoding identifies a secondary resource and implicitly indicates
that the client is willing to use a proxy and that the server allows this use.
The client is then able to request the secondary resource from a proxy cache
rather than directly to the origin server.

In this document, the origin server is able to act in the role of the secondary
server in [SCD].  However, all of the considerations that apply to having a
secondary server host content apply instead to the proxy cache.  Thus, integrity
and confidentiality protections against the proxy cache are the primary
consideration.


## Signaling Presence of a Proxy

Without a clear signal from the client that a caching proxy is present, an
origin server is unable to send a response with out-of-band encoding.  A value
of `out-of-band` in the Accept-Encoding header field only indicates
willingness to use the secure content delegation mechanism.

A new `oobp` content encoding is defined.  The `oobp` content encoding is
identical to the `out-of-band` content encoding, with the following additional
conditions:

* A client MUST NOT signal support for `oobp` content encoding unless it is
  using a proxy cache and it is willing to direct requests to that proxy.

* A server MUST NOT encode a response using the `oobp` content encoding unless
  it permits the request to be made to a proxy cache.

* The `oobp` content encoding MUST NOT be used to encode the contents of a
  request.  The `out-of-band` content encoding is sufficient for that purpose.

Using a different content encoding name means that a resource using secure
content delegation to a secondary server [SCD] does not inadvertently trigger a
request via a proxy.

The security properties of delegation via a secondary server and via a caching
proxy are similar only to the extent that a third party is involved.  However,
it might be the case that a secondary server has a stronger relationship with
the primary server and additional constraints on its actions, such as
contractual limitations.  Such constraints might make it feasible to delegate to
a secondary server selected by the primary server.  A caching proxy might not be
considered acceptable in the same way.

The `oobp` content encoding clearly indicates that the client is permitted to
retrieve content from a proxy-cache.

Servers that use the `oobp` content encoding MUST include header fields for
message integrity and encryption, such as the M-I header field
[I-D.thomson-http-mice] or the Crypto-Key header field
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].  Clients MUST NOT send a request via a
proxy if these headers are not present.  Absence of these header fields indicate
an error on the part of the origin server, since integrity and confidentiality
protection are mandatory.


## Proxy Identification and Authentication

This mechanism does not work with a transparent caching proxy.  Since the
request is made over end-to-end HTTPS in the absence of a proxy, the feature
will not be used unless the proxy is known to the client.

A proxy cache MUST therefore be expressly configured or discovered.  This
produces a name and possibly a port number for the proxy.  The proxy MUST be
contacted using HTTPS [RFC2818] and authenticated using the configured or
discovered domain name.

Issue:

: What signal do we need from the proxy cache that it supports receiving
  requests with an `https://` scheme?  Can we expect that a proxy cache will
  happily accept a request for an HTTPS URL?  What if they ignore the scheme and
  send the request in the clear?


# Performance Optimizations

As noted in [SCD], the secondary request required by out-of-band content
encoding imposes a performance penalty.  This can be mitigated by priming
clients with information about the location and disposition of resources prior
to the client making a request.  A resource map described in [SCD] might be
provided to clients to eliminate the latency involved in making requests of the
origin server for resources that might be cached.


## Proxy Cache Priming

A client that makes a request of an origin server via an unprimed proxy cache will
suffer additional latency as a consequence of the cache having to make a request
to the origin server.

The following options are possible:

* Clients can speculatively make requests to a proxy cache based on information
  it learns from a resource map, or from hints like the "prefetch" link relation
  [HINTS].  To avoid a potential waste of resources as a result of receiving
  complete responses, speculative requests might be limited to HEAD requests;
  alternatively, HTTP/2 [RFC7540] flow control might be used to allow only
  limited information to be sent.

* The origin server might provide the proxy cache with "prefetch" link relations
  in responses to requests for secondary resources.  These link relations might
  identify other resources that the proxy might retrieve speculatively.  This
  does not improve the latency of the initial request, but could improve
  subsequent requests.


# Security Considerations {#security}

All the considerations of [SCD] apply.  In particular, content that is
distributed with the assistance of a proxy cache MUST include integrity and
confidentiality protection.  That means that the M-I header field
[I-D.thomson-http-mice] and the Crypto-Key header field
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding] or equivalent information MUST be present
in responses that include an out-of-band content encoding.

Clients that receive a response without the information necessary to ensure
integrity and confidentiality protection against a proxy cache MUST NOT make a
request to a proxy to retrieve that response.  Clients could treat such a
response as failed.  Clients MAY then make the request directly to the origin
server, or - if request can be safely retried - retry a request without the
out-of-band token in the Accept-Encoding header field.
